# Privacy-Preserving-Donkey-Car
`donkey_env.py` is a source file I directly modify from the donkey car source code.
`generate_validations.py` is runs some test hash functions on some images.
`plot_tensorboard.py` takes in 1 or more tensorboard training logs and plots them with matplotlib (allows for customisation).
`ppo.py` is the script that is runs the training or testing pipeline.
